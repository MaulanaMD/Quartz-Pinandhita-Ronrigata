This page contains the means of contacting us, and also payment method for our commissions.

## Contacts

There are a few ways you can contact us to make a commission.

The easiest way to do so is through sending personal message to `amasakimei` via Discord.

If you don't have a Discord account, or refuse to have one, you can contact us through e-mail, for now via our leader's: `maulanamd@proton.me` - this could change as we prepare a dedicated e-mail address for this.

The other way is to contact us through our social media's presence. We're available on Facebook, which you can check on https://www.facebook.com/pinandhita.ronrigata/.

## Payments

For local commission (Japanese-Indonesian), we supports payment through BCA as direct payment method.

For international commission (Japanese-English), we supports payment through PayPal as direct payment method.

We will send you the account details for payment in the process of commission.
