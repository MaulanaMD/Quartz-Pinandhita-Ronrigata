This page contains guidelines on what we can and we can't work on, and also a breakdown on how our pricing works.

## Guidelines

### Tags/Genre

We accepts doujinshi translation, be it SFW (Non-H tags on sadpanda) or not. The exception being:

- Doujinshi with `scat` tags - but other extreme tags like `gore` are likely accepted;
- Doujinshi with `yaoi` tags;
- Doujinshi with prevalent use of Japanese dialects. Kansai are fine most of the time, but with other dialects like Akita and others, we can't guarantee a good translation for those.

### Pricing Guidelines

The price for our doujinshi translation changes depending on two things: *the amount of text* and *the amount of things needed to edit*.

#### Text amount

The amount of text in a page are based on how many text elements are in one page and how dense/long it is.

Consider this:

> [!example]- Example 01 - Text elements
> ![[example-text-amount01.webp|350]]

This manga page has 10 translatable text elements. This is the maximum amount of text element that count for the lower pricing (USD 0.75 per page). In other words, pages that have 11+ text elements are billed USD 1 per page.

For text density/length, the usual suspects are afterword/あとがき pages.

Let's see another example:

> [!example]- Example 02 - Text density
> ![[example-text-amount03.png|350]]
> ![[example-text-amount04.jpg|350]]

For ease of counting, we count each sentence as a separate text element. In the example above, there are three sentence on this page, so we'll count it as having three text elements.

Elements that have wall of text (tba for examples) will be counted as two or three separate elements, depending on how long it is.

#### Editing amount (especially redraws)

This basically boils down to this: if we look at a glance of a page and thought, *"fuck, that's a lot of thing to redraw,"* we will charge the higher price for those pages, USD 1 instead of USD 0.75.

The usual suspect for this are sfx, but transparent/semi-transparent balloon text can count for this as well.

Example of redraws:

> [!example]- Example 03 - Redraw (Semi-transparent balloon texts, from raws > edited raws > typesetted final image)
> ![[example-edit-amount03.jpg|200]]
> ![[example-edit-amount04.webp|200]]
> ![[example-edit-amount05.jpg|200]]

Here is an extreme example for sfx:

> [!example]- Example 04 - Sfx (NSFW)
> ![[example-edit-amount01.jpg|350]]
> You can easily see that there's a shitton of sfx texts that needs to be redrawn over so that translated sfx can be written into.

That being said, we don't redraw over obvious sfx (like those sex sounds on the example above) by default, unless it gives impact on how you read it. What does this mean?

Sex sfx (*plap plap plap* for example) are repetitive most of the time, and without reading it, you can usually know what it means with the broader context of the pages/scenes - it doesn't matter much, basically.

Other sfx, on the other hands, are usually more important for the context of the pages/scenes. We will redraw and translate this kind of sfx as we see fit.

Example on this:

> [!example]- Example 05 - Sfx
> ![[example-edit-amount02.jpg|350]]
>
> You can see, especially on the lower panels, that there's a lot of sfx. As in this context it illustrates how Fem!Sensei (the girl being choked) gasping for air, we see that it is important to translate it over. The other examples are on the upper panels, being the *reach* and *grip* sfx.

An alternative solution for this redraw sfx problem is to just put the sfx translation on the side for the those that needs to have extensive redraw, like the one we did on the example above (in this case, I (Thea) am just being lazy as this is not a doujinshi releases). For this, the edit/redraw won't be counted as complicated (thus lower price instead of higher), as we will just not do the complicated redraw.

As we said before, this is our default routine for translating - *if you want all of the sfx redrawn all over, you can say so and we'll do it for a price*.
