## Commentary

Doujinshi translation number 5.

This is the first doujinshi that's related to [[22.03 CHOCOLATE & CREAM|CHOCOLATE & CREAM]], made also by Syoukaki. Technically, C&C are sort-of mini-doujinshi, that can be seen from the overall length of both of them. Shuten Doujin Translation are going to upload translation of Syoukaki's C104 release, BEACHFRONT'S DREAM, which is continuation of C&C and Oshioki no Jikan, soon after this translation is uploaded.

Also, new Decagrammaton story are to be added in JP Server. May this translation serve as our hopium for Rio's playable release.

The premise of Rio hiding in Schale's locker to meet/oversee Sensei is just so fucking funny to me. Also, I finally get what "Sensei's Secret Diary" in C&C pg09 meant after translating this. I thought it meant as "all-knowing Rio" generic gag, but it is a subplot from this book.
