## Commentary

2nd doujinshi release!

We've also finished preparing our payment details for commission and Ko-fi, which means we're open for commission! See [[index#Commission Guides]] for subpages about this.

You might not realize it, but the artist draws all of the student's halo, it's just that all of it is drawn as if it's translucent.

I want to leave this here:

> [!quote] From Blue Archive's Tvtropes *Tear Jerker* entry 
> In her battle against Arius Squad and subsequent escape, Azusa left behind the Peroro doll that Hifumi gave her, something that Saori thought would ensure that Azusa will come back to because it is so important to her. However, that is not the case; Azusa bobby-trapped the doll, and not just with any normal explosives, but with the halo-destroying bomb which was to be used for Seia's assassination. Azusa knew that she had turned that proof of friendship, the very thing she promised she'd cherish for the rest of her life, into a tool of murder. As the bomb went off, Azusa simply collapsed in an abandoned spot as she curled up into her knees and cried, quietly apologizing to Hifumi while thinking that she could never go back after what she had done.
