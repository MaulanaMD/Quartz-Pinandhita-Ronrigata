## Commentary

Fourth translated doujinshi.

Here's a translation note about a little thing on page 14.

> [!notice] TL Note
> 「仄暗い優越感」, translated as “grim superiority,” is meant as how someone hides a more sinister side of them when dealing with others where they hold a higher position or relation with them. In this context, it’s how original Arona/Plana knew that she might only be used as an escape by Sensei when he can’t lay his hand onto them when he needs affection and care—the dicothomy between student and non-student are the one highlighted here.
> 
> We opted to translate it in a more roundabout way, though, in the end. Hopefully the complicated relationship of Plana and Phrenaptes!Sensei could still be conveyed overall.

Overall, a magnificent doujinshi from Shoa as usual.
