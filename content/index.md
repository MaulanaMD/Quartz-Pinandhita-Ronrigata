# Welcome!

We're a freelance translation circle for Japanese-English-Indonesian language that specialize in ACG-related works. We're not really bound by a certain fandom, but right now we're just doing [[10.01 What We Offers#What is a doujinshi, you ask?|doujinshi]] from series/fandom our members are interested in.

This website serve as a home for our activities, including commission details and releases. If you want to make a commission to us, check [[index#Commission Guides]] to see the details.
